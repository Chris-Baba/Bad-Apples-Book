## _Bad Apples, Bad Water_
### _Lead Arsenate Pesticide, the Holocaust, and Beyound_

This book will help you understand the real reason behind most of the senseless acts of violence that occured in the last 125 years.  Both World Wars and the Holocaust were largely caused by lead arsenate, an arsenic containing pesticide that was used extensively in the 1900's.

Billions of pounds of this poison were applied to farms all over the world.

We are still experiencing the effects of this poison which has been slowly creeping into many of our water supplies.  This has been causing many instances of mass murder and other neo-Nazi types of behavior against ethnic minorities.
